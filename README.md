<h1>Greetings traveler... ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Eric. I am a bookworm and cycling nerd with a passion for change. 

I have spent the last half decade working with self driving cars. Most recently I have had the opportunity to test and build simulated driving scenarios with [Applied Intuition's](https://www.appliedintuition.com/simulation) Simian software stack. Working with the monthly versions of the same program has given me invaluable experience and interest in software tesing and QA. 

In my spare time I tinker with any coding I projects that strike my fancy. I love the challenge of learning new skills and applying that knowledge to solve problems.
